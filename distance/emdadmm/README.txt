This .zip contains a simple Matlab implementation of the ADMM algorithm proposed in:

"Earth Mover's Distances on Discrete Surfaces"
J. Solomon, R. Rustamov, L. Guibas, and A. Butscher
SIGGRAPH 2014, Vancouver

It should NOT be used for timing comparison or for mission-critical applications. This particular implementation is still in "alpha" stage, so please contact Justin with questions, bugs, or help with particular applications from the paper (justin.solomon@stanford.edu).

To get started, run "testEarthMoversADMM.m," which computes EMD between two distributions on a horse model.
